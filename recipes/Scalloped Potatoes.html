    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Creamy, cheesy and perfectly indulgent, scalloped potatoes are a classic for good reason. While cooking, the starch from the potatoes thickens the cream into a luscious sauce while the cheesy topping becomes golden and nutty in the oven. Allowing the casserole to rest for 10 minutes before serving makes it easier to slice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Medium russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>

        <li>Grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
